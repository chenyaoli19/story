# story

I want to create a website similar to storycorps, where people can tell their own life stories. As a millennial born in China, I felt my country has evolved greatly over the past 20 years, and for some reason I felt obligated to record these changes, possibly through the way I'm most familiar with - internet technologies. From 20 years ago, going abroad and study in a US college/university was only for the top talents or kids from super rich family, but it has been changed a lot in recent years. Chinese are getting involved in global business, education, policy making and more. I would like to hear what people's own stories are, and use that as a mirror to show the world how we have evovled.
